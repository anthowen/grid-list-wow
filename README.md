# Mergeable Grid list

The tool helps users to merge any adjacent tiles in a grid list so that they can create customized views as they want. Once they customize the view, they can place whatever the content they would like, like images, videos, and livestreams into each tile. That experience is just WOW.

The functionality is pretty much similar to `merge` in `Excel`.

4. Keep merging cells until you find a good-looking view
